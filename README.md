# PHotocoPier
A PHP-based text copier that runs mainly on cURL.

# What's this?
A PHP-based text copier to easily copy text from multiple sources

# How to use?
1. Download file (the PHotocoPier.php)
2. Edit as needed (editable areas are marked, you can edit non-editable areas, but proceed at your own risk)
3. Save and upload to somewhere you need it

# Extra notes
- **[IMPORTANT!!]** Please obtain permission from the source text file owner(s) if possible before copying, this is not intended for scraping purposes.
- **[IMPORTANT!!]** Please comply with your hosting provider(s) usage limits, the user using it is liable to any consequences arises, not the developer of this.
- You can use cronjobs on your hosting provider of your choice to automate the process, when setting it, please use "Fetch a URL" (this is on Plesk-based control panels, should be something similar for other hosting control panels) instead of "Run a PHP script" (or similar on other hosting control panels, don't ask why it doesn't work somehow)

# Known Issues
- Unless there is an error, there will be no outputs, it will just display an empty page (no plans on fixing this, download and edit/fork yourself the success output if you need it)
- No guarantees on dynamic sites (most likely will fail, but not tested and no plans to, since this is more on copying mainly text-based stuff such as .txt and the like)
